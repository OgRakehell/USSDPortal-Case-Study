## Problem Statement (Before USSDPortal)
### Customer Pain

- Customers who just opened accounts could not register for USSD on the same day

- Enrollment attempts frequently failed with system or validation errors

- Customers were asked to wait 24 hours or return another day

- This created a poor first impression at a critical trust-building moment

### Operational Pain

- CSOs faced repeated complaints they could not resolve immediately

- Manual escalations to operations and IT teams increased

- No visibility into enrollment exceptions or tracking of pending requests

- High dependency on overnight batch sync processes

### Business Impact

- Delayed channel adoption

- Increased branch congestion and repeat visits

- Higher support workload and operational friction

- Reduced customer satisfaction during onboarding
