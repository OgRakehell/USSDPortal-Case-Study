## Product Goal

Enable secure, auditable, same-day USSD enrollment for newly onboarded customers directly from the branch, without bypassing existing controls or compliance requirements.

## Solution: USSDPortal

USSDPortal is a role-based internal web application that allows branch staff to initiate and authorize USSD enrollment for newly opened accounts using verified customer documentation.

The portal integrates with backend enrollment services while enforcing maker–checker controls, audit trails, and approval workflows.
